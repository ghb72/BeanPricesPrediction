Ok bros!
This is the repo of the analysis and predictions of prices of the bayo beans and the weather
of the region with the higher production of the grain in mexico.
So the total amount of bean produced in this region is highly correlated to the final price.

This is the first version, so it has a poor structure, sorry.
In next commits I will fix it.
